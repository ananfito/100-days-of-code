### Day 92: November 5, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Continued working on the theme button selector the the calculator app. I'm getting closer and closer to the design specifications. I also learned about the CSS grids and units.

**Thoughts:** Today's study session was long and productive. I learned about CSS grid which helped me get my theme selector buttons where I wanted to them, but I'm feeling a little bit frustrated because there is some extra space in one of my `div` within a grid and I'm not sure why. I assume it has something do with some styling property I have (or do not have). For now, I think I need to step away from this project and come back to it later with a fresh mind and fresh perspective.
