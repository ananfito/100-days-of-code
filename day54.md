### Day 54: September 28, 2022

**Today's Progress:** I continued working [Intermediate Algorithm Scripting](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/#intermediate-algorithm-scripting) challenges on freeCodeCamp; 38% complete

**Thoughts:** Today I had a really great and productive study session (albeit split up through the day). I managed to get through two challenges ('Search and replace' and 'DNA Pairing') on freeCodeCamp. Neither dealt with regular expressions so they were a bit easier than the challenges I worked on today.

I'm very proud of myself for getting through the 'Search and replace' challenge without having to consult any sources except the documentation. This felt good and I was excited to do more. I had a similar experience with the 'DNA Pairing' challenge, but I did consult the solution just so that I could read the problem explanation; the initial explanation was vague and didn't make clear how the DNA base pairs match up.

For both challenges (and the third challenge I started, but didn't finish) I implemented the following strategy:
- Read and make sense of the problem by re-writing the explanation
- Outline the steps/parts need to solve the problem in pseudo-code
- Build each part and test it
- Put it all together
- Test and experiment until a solution is found

In hindsight, this strategy seems obvious and it may have been similar to how I tackled previous scripting challenges, but today I was more consistent with implementing it. There were multiple times where I wanted to jump straight into the problem, but I forced myself to follow my strategy. I think it contributed to my success today and prevent some of the frustration I was feeling on the previous days when I studied. I will definitely remember it and implement again in the future.
