### Day 74: October 18, 2022

**Today's Progress:** I continued working [Intermediate Algorithm Scripting](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/#intermediate-algorithm-scripting) challenges on freeCodeCamp; I am currently 76% complete with this section.

**Thoughts:** The 'Drop It' challenge didn't make sense to me until I consulted the challenge guide. This is something I've noticed before with the freeCodeCamp's descriptions. I'm still not sure if it's intentional - since often times in the real world you don't have clearly defined problems and have to work hard to understand the problem before you can start to solve it - or if it's just not well-written to begin with.

Conversely, the 'Steamroller' challenge was straight-forward to me, except for the concept of recursion. This is something I'll need to study more deeply at a later date (I've already added it to my 'Identified Weaknesses' list).  

Overall, I'm satisfied with the progress I made today.
