### Day 99: November 12, 2022

**Today's Progress:** I initialized a new Frontend Mentor project and I started a crash course for Git and GitHub.

**Thoughts:** I made it to the end of the 100DaysOfCode challenge! I know it says "Day 99" but it's actually Day 100 because I started my numbering at "Day 0". I have plans to do an in-depth reflection of the whole challenge, but for now I'll focus on where I'm at today.

I decided to put the calculator app on hold for now. I was growing more and more frustrated with trying to get the theme button to work. After reflecting, I realized I think this "intermediate" level challenge is a bit beyond my capabilities right now and is creating more frustration than learning. So I initialized a new project (the product preview card) and started learning how Git and GitHub works.

Previously, I've been using GitHub Desktop to synchronized my local repos with my remote repos. This has worked well, but I decided it's time to learn how to use Git to do this task. I plan to practice these skills as I work on this Frontend Mentor project.

So far I'm starting to get how Git works in the command line interface, but what I've already recognized is you have to type the same things (i.e., `git add .`, `git commit -m ""`, `git push`, etc.) and it's not quite clear to me why developers would choose this way of updating repos as opposed to using a desktop application like GitHub Desktop. If the crash course doesn't clarify this for me, I plan to look into it. I'm not opposed to using either, but I do have preference for GitHub Desktop because it seems more efficient to me.
