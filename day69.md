### Day 69: October 13, 2022

**Today's Progress:** I continued working [Intermediate Algorithm Scripting](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/#intermediate-algorithm-scripting) challenges on freeCodeCamp; 52% complete. I made some progress on the 'Sum Odd Fibonacci Numbers' but it's still incomplete.

**Thoughts:** Today was my first day back at coding after a long (unexpected) hiatus. It didn't take me long to get back into the swing of things, but I didn't make as much progress as I would have liked. I was hoping to finish the current challenge ('Sum Odd Fibonacci Numbers') but my solution is failing to pass the tests.

After reflecting on what my outputs were (vs. the expected output) I believe my solution was calculating excess Fibonacci Numbers. Further, my initial solution did not account for the odd numbers (it summed them all) - however I was able to correct that section of code.

My next steps are to review the challenge guide and watch the tutorial video I found to see if it'll help me understand why my current solution is working.
