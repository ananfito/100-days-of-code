### Day 58: October 2, 2022

**Today's Progress:** I wrote a [blog post](https://ananfito.hashnode.dev/regular-expressions-a-basic-explanation) explaining the concept of regular expressions.

**Thoughts:** In effort to be more focus, I've decided to start doing weekly blog posts where I focus on a particular topic I'm struggling with. This week I chose to write about regular expressions. This is something I've struggled with for a while now.

After writing the article, I feel a little more confident about the topic, but I think one article is two limited to explain the full scope of use cases for regular expressions. I may turn this into a series of articles in effort to better understand these and explain it to others.
