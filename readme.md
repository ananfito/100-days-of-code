### Day 79: October 23, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Today I continued following the [JavaScript DOM Manipulation Course](https://youtu.be/5fb2aPlgoys) taught by [CodeLab](https://www.youtube.com/c/CodeLab98) and hosted on freeCodeCamp's YouTube channel.

**Thoughts:** Everything went smoothly during today's study session. I started setting up the HTML & CSS files for the project - which was a really good review - and I'm ready to start with the JavaScript in my next session.

Overall, I'm enjoying this change to a project since it has re-energized my desire to learn.
