### Day 97: November 10, 2022

**Today's Progress:** I continued working on the calculator app; I added styling to make it mobile friendly. I also watched (& followed along with) a tutorial on setting up a theme button.

**Thoughts:** I'm satisfied with the progress I'm making on this project, but a little frustrated with the tutorial video I watched today. I followed along but the end product only worked in the Chrome web browser (even though the tutorial include JavaScript that would account for browser compatibility). I'm not sure if I need to try and fix the error (if there is one) or try a different approach.
