### Day 59: October 3, 2022

**Today's Progress:** I continued working [Intermediate Algorithm Scripting](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/#intermediate-algorithm-scripting) challenges on freeCodeCamp; 48% complete.

I also published the [blog post about regular expressions](https://ananfito.hashnode.dev/regular-expressions-a-basic-explanation) that I had written yesterday.

**Thoughts:** Today's session was brief, but I learned two key things: (1) the `for...of` loop makes certain iterative steps easier, and (2) the logical not `!` can be used inside an `if` statement.

I stumbled upon the `for...of` loop while watching a tutorial video about the solution to a challenge on freeCodeCamp. I was stuck on the challenge and had tried a few different variations of the logical statement and my `for` loop but couldn't get it to work (even though when I tested the pieces of it with `console.log()` which should the individual pieces worked, but not the whole). Thankfully, the suggestion in the tutorial help solve that problem.

After consulting the documentation for the `for...of` loop I found that this type of loop is quite useful for iterative processes. Especially in this challenge where I had to check each item within a series of arrays. After tweaking my initial, ordinary `for` loop to become a `for...of` loop, it made the solution more simple.

Further, the tutorial also talked about the using the logical not `!` inside an `if` statement - which seems obvious to me now, but before I didn't think that was possible. I had assumed that you needed to using something like `if ( /* condition */ === false)` in order to get the negated version (or the equivalent statement `if ( /* condition */ !=== true)`). Discovering this was both helpful solving the challenge, but also helpful for future challenges (I wish I had known it for some previous challenges).

I would have liked to have studied further, but unfortunately my study session got interrupted by a flood evacuation for my apartment. Thankfully, my partner and I (and our valuable belongings) are safe, but that meant least time for studying. However, sometimes there are more important things than studying.
