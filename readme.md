### Day 0: August 8, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Started working on Basic JavaScript course created by freeCodeCamp. Currently 34% complete with the course. Got stuck on the 'Word Blanks' activity but after staring at it for several minutes, having my partner look at it, I finally found the answer in a [forum](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/word-blanks-hey-guys-i-need-help-i-cant-seem-to-get-this-right-i-have-passed-all-the-words-into-word-blanks-but-its-still-not-right/225558/8?u=codebyfifi). My error was syntatical and I forgot to include spaces before AND after the variables in the concatenated string.

**Thoughts:** Next time I think I need to work a little earlier in the evening. I worked 8pm-9pm and my brain was tired which made reading on a screen (and understanding some instructions) difficult. I did however listen to [Vivaldi's 'Four Seasons - Winter'](https://youtu.be/ZPdk5GaIDjo) on repeat which helped me focus.

**Link to work:** For progress see the timeline on my [freeCodeCamp Profile](https://www.freecodecamp.org/ananfito).
