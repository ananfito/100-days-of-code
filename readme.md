### Day 3: August 8, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Continued working on [Basic JavaScript](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/#basic-javascript) course created by freeCodeCamp. Currently 79% complete with the course.

**Thoughts:** Today went smoothly. I needed to look up a few things for reference (e.g., the syntax of a switch statement), but other than that I had no issues.

### Day 2: August 7, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Continued working on [Basic JavaScript](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/#basic-javascript) course created by freeCodeCamp. Currently 71% complete with the course.

**Thoughts:** Sadly, I had to cut my study session short because I had a headache which was making staring at screen (and problem-solving) difficult, but I'm still happy I got a quick session in to complete a few challenges. Again, while coding I listened to [Vivaldi's 'Four Seasons - Winter'](https://youtu.be/ZPdk5GaIDjo) on repeat which helped me focus.

### Day 1: August 6, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Continued working on [Basic JavaScript](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/#basic-javascript) course created by freeCodeCamp. Currently 66% complete with the course. Challenges went smoothly today.

**Thoughts:** I felt pretty good about today's study session. I did it first thing in the morning so I was more alert which helped a lot. So far the JavaScript isn't too challenging; it's been a good review of the math concepts and the programming concepts (I've previously studied Python Programming). Again, while coding I listened to [Vivaldi's 'Four Seasons - Winter'](https://youtu.be/ZPdk5GaIDjo) on repeat which helped me focus. Setting a time for an hour also helps, though next time I think I might use an interval timer so that I take short breaks during the hour to stand up and stretch.

### Day 0: August 5, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Started working on Basic JavaScript course created by freeCodeCamp. Currently 34% complete with the course. Got stuck on the 'Word Blanks' activity but after staring at it for several minutes, having my partner look at it, I finally found the answer in a [forum](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/word-blanks-hey-guys-i-need-help-i-cant-seem-to-get-this-right-i-have-passed-all-the-words-into-word-blanks-but-its-still-not-right/225558/8?u=codebyfifi). My error was syntactical and I forgot to include spaces before AND after the variables in the concatenated string.

**Thoughts:** Next time I think I need to work a little earlier in the evening. I worked 8pm-9pm and my brain was tired which made reading on a screen (and understanding some instructions) difficult. I did however listen to [Vivaldi's 'Four Seasons - Winter'](https://youtu.be/ZPdk5GaIDjo) on repeat which helped me focus.
