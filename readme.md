### Day 80: October 24, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Today I continued following the [JavaScript DOM Manipulation Course](https://youtu.be/5fb2aPlgoys) taught by [CodeLab](https://www.youtube.com/c/CodeLab98) and hosted on freeCodeCamp's YouTube channel. I completed the random quote generator and modal projects while also starting the stopwatch project.

**Thoughts:** I'm really enjoying this mine-course on DOM Manipulation with JavaScript. It's letting me see specific use cases for various JavaScript functions and methods while also giving me a good review of HTML and CSS. This has renewed my interested and given me insight into what's possible. I enjoy the intellectual challenge that comes with the coding challenges on freeCodeCamp, but they are often abstract and devoid of practical uses. This course has been an excellent experience in how to put these ideas into practice. Especially since I've seen things like the modal and accordion as a user of the web. It's neat to know how they work and that I can make one myself.
