### Day 64: October 8, 2022

**Today's Progress:** I took a break from coding today and I had a no-code studying session. I learned about accessibility on the web and JSON.

*Quotes & Key Ideas:*
- Hidden links can be used to skip content on websites to make it more accessible for people using keyboards or assistive devices.
- JSON = JavaScript Object Notation
  - Data representation format
  - Commonly used for APIs and Configs
  - Lightweight and easy to read/write
  - Integrates easily with most languages
- JSON Types: strings, numbers, booleans, null, arrays, objects
  - Note: when using strings in JSON you need to use double quotes `""` not single quotes `''`. In JavaScript it doesn't matter, but in JSON it does.

**Thoughts:** It's been a challenging. Personally, I've been dealing with stress at work while also having to temporarily evacuate my apartment due to flooding. Thankfully, the flooding only blocked the roads and did not damage the apartment, but all of that made it difficult to stay focus and study.

I wanted to do more today and maybe I will later in the day, but I decided to keep things light and step away from the freeCodeCamp challenges. Instead, I watched some of the YouTube tutorials I saved to my 'Watch Later' list. It might not have been the most challenging or productive study session, but it was informative.
