### Day 95: November 8, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Today I watched another tutorial on setting up a theme button and I started styling the colors of the first theme on the calculator app.

**Thoughts:** Slowly but surely I'm making my way toward completing this project. When I started I thought the JavaScript might be the most complex thing (and it might still be) but I'm finding the CSS styling is really what's challenging me (but in a good way). I've learned more about CSS styling in the project than I thought I would and I'm really grateful because I think it's filling in some knowledge gaps.
