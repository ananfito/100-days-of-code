### Day 6: August 11, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Continued working on [Basic JavaScript](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/#basic-javascript) course created by freeCodeCamp. Currently 91% complete with the course. Today's challenges focused on writing a function to look up names and properties in a contacts array.

**Thoughts:** I'm tired. I got home late after an after-work dinner with some colleagues. I only spent about 20 minutes (not a full hour, but better than nothing) on today's challenge. I was able to get a rough outline of the function complete, but my brain is too tired to think clearly through the logic loops on this one. I'll have to save it for tomorrow.

In looking for resources to help solve this problem, I stumbled upon the book [*Eloquent JavaScript*](https://eloquentjavascript.net/) by Marjin Haverbeke. I'm enjoying freeCodeCamp's guided challenges (which do get progressively harder), but I think this book will help me understand some of the theory on a deeper level. It also has some chapters that focus on a building projects which is something I enjoy. What's the point of learning new skills if you can create something after, right?

### Day 5: August 10, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Continued working on [Basic JavaScript](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/#basic-javascript) course created by freeCodeCamp. Currently 91% complete with the course - almost done! Today's challenges focused on iterations with loops. Here are some notes and key ideas I saved from today's session:

- `for` loops are declared with three optional expressions separated by semicolons:
`for (a; b; c)`, where `a` is the initialization statement, `b` is the condition statement, and `c` is the final expression
- a `do...while` loop because it will first do one pass of the code inside the loop no matter what, and then continue to run the loop `while` the specified condition evaluates to `true`
 - Essentially, a `do...while` loop ensures that the code inside the loop will run at least once

**Thoughts:**  This was a good review lesson for me - both of the mathematics involved in the loops and the loops themselves. I've previously taken a Python programming course so I was familiar with the concepts of loops, but in JavaScript the syntax and setup is a little different so it was good to get that experience.

I switched up my music today. I was feeling a little sleepy so I decided to listen to something a with a little more pep in it. I really enjoy the use of drum beats and string instruments in this song from the Battlestar Galactic (2005 reboot) *Prelude to War* composed by Bear McCreary:

### Day 4: August 9, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Continued working on [Basic JavaScript](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/#basic-javascript) course created by freeCodeCamp. Currently 84% complete with the course. Today's challenges focused on using objects for lookups, testing/manipulating objects, and accessing nested objects and arrays.

**Thoughts:**  I'm not sure if these challenges were more difficult for me or if I was just tired, but I had to look things up and get some hints to make it through. It made me progress more slowly than I would have liked, but I'm okay with that - I don't want to go too quickly. Most of my troubles or 'road blocks' today came from minor typos (yay syntax errors!) and forgetting little things like '==' vs. '==='. Again, I'm not sure if it's because I'm tired or if I need some review, but a little review of the basics couldn't hurt.  

I continued listening to [Vivaldi's 'Four Seasons - Winter'](https://youtu.be/ZPdk5GaIDjo) on repeat to help me focus AND I used an interval timer so that I would get up and move every 20 minutes, instead of sitting for an entire hour.

### Day 3: August 8, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Continued working on [Basic JavaScript](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/#basic-javascript) course created by freeCodeCamp. Currently 79% complete with the course.

**Thoughts:** Today went smoothly. I needed to look up a few things for reference (e.g., the syntax of a switch statement), but other than that I had no issues.

### Day 2: August 7, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Continued working on [Basic JavaScript](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/#basic-javascript) course created by freeCodeCamp. Currently 71% complete with the course.

**Thoughts:** Sadly, I had to cut my study session short because I had a headache which was making staring at screen (and problem-solving) difficult, but I'm still happy I got a quick session in to complete a few challenges. Again, while coding I listened to [Vivaldi's 'Four Seasons - Winter'](https://youtu.be/ZPdk5GaIDjo) on repeat which helped me focus.

### Day 1: August 6, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Continued working on [Basic JavaScript](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/#basic-javascript) course created by freeCodeCamp. Currently 66% complete with the course. Challenges went smoothly today.

**Thoughts:** I felt pretty good about today's study session. I did it first thing in the morning so I was more alert which helped a lot. So far the JavaScript isn't too challenging; it's been a good review of the math concepts and the programming concepts (I've previously studied Python Programming). Again, while coding I listened to [Vivaldi's 'Four Seasons - Winter'](https://youtu.be/ZPdk5GaIDjo) on repeat which helped me focus. Setting a time for an hour also helps, though next time I think I might use an interval timer so that I take short breaks during the hour to stand up and stretch.

### Day 0: August 5, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Started working on Basic JavaScript course created by freeCodeCamp. Currently 34% complete with the course. Got stuck on the 'Word Blanks' activity but after staring at it for several minutes, having my partner look at it, I finally found the answer in a [forum](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/word-blanks-hey-guys-i-need-help-i-cant-seem-to-get-this-right-i-have-passed-all-the-words-into-word-blanks-but-its-still-not-right/225558/8?u=codebyfifi). My error was syntactical and I forgot to include spaces before AND after the variables in the concatenated string.

**Thoughts:** Next time I think I need to work a little earlier in the evening. I worked 8pm-9pm and my brain was tired which made reading on a screen (and understanding some instructions) difficult. I did however listen to [Vivaldi's 'Four Seasons - Winter'](https://youtu.be/ZPdk5GaIDjo) on repeat which helped me focus.
