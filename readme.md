### Day 60: October 4, 2022

**Today's Progress:** I continued working [Intermediate Algorithm Scripting](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/#intermediate-algorithm-scripting) challenges on freeCodeCamp; 48% complete.

**Thoughts:** I started, but did not finish the 'Convert HTML Entities' challenge on freeCodeCamp. Part of the script I wrote works for some of the test, but doesn't work for the others. After consulting the hints, I believe my error was in trying to only the `replace()` method when I need to, instead, split the string up before replace the characters. However, I haven't checked the solutions yet so maybe my approach is still valid. I'll continue tweaking the script tomorrow.

I would have liked to study more but I didn't have the time and kept getting interrupted. That aside, I'm still satisfied with what I accomplished today. I do enjoy the challenge of figuring out the pieces of the script and seeing how they fit together to solve a problem.
