### Day 83: October 27, 2022

**Today's Progress:** I continued working on the calculator app challenge I started yesterday, but didn't get very far. I'm stuck on the CSS Styling for the theme buttons.

**Thoughts:** Today's session wasn't super productive but I think I'm getting closer to how to style the theme buttons for the calculator. The two tutorials I watched helped me realize that I should be using radio input buttons instead of regular buttons. However, styling the radio buttons will be tricky and that's where I got stuck. I wanted to keep pushing myself, but my head hurt so I decide to opt for rest instead.
