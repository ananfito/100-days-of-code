### Day 81: October 25, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Today I finished  the [JavaScript DOM Manipulation Course](https://youtu.be/5fb2aPlgoys) taught by [CodeLab](https://www.youtube.com/c/CodeLab98) and hosted on freeCodeCamp's YouTube channel. I completed the 'Stopwatch' and 'To-Do List' projects.

**Thoughts:** I really enjoyed this course. It helped me understand some key concepts from the Basic Tetris app I created a few weeks ago. In particular, it's given me a deeper understanding of how methods like the `eventListener` work and add a greater degree of functionality to a website. I can already envision different uses cases which is really empowering. For a while I was beginning to question what is the point of all this, but after going through this tutorial I can see directly what the point of it all is **AND** that's exciting. I already have an idea for calculator app I want to design based on this tutorial to challenge myself and improve my skills.
