### Day 62: October 6, 2022

**Today's Progress:** I continued working [Intermediate Algorithm Scripting](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/#intermediate-algorithm-scripting) challenges on freeCodeCamp; 52% complete.

**Thoughts:** I made little progress on the 'Sum All Odd Fibonacci Numbers' challenge. Overall, it's been a challenging week and I've had little time and energy to devote to studying.
