### Day 82: October 26, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Today I started working on the calculator app I am creating. In fact, I am completing this as part of a challenge I found on Frontend Mentor. I downloaded the files, setup my repo, and started coding the HTML and CSS files.

**Thoughts:** I really happy with this project choice. So far it seems to be the right level of complexity for where I'm at in my learning. I'm also happy I found the challenge on Frontend Mentor because (initially) I was unsure of where to get started but I didn't really want to watch a YouTube tutorial where all the coding is done for me and I just follow along. I really wanted something I could work on myself, but needed a little guidance to get started. I'm grateful for the Frontend Mentor challenge because it offers just that.
