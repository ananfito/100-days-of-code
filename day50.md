### Day 50: September 24, 2022

**Today's Progress:** I only completed 1 [Intermediate Algorithm Scripting](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/#intermediate-algorithm-scripting) challenges on freeCodeCamp, but I'm now 19% complete with this section.

I also wrote a blog post reflecting on the first half of my #100DaysOfCode challenge.

**Thoughts:** I'm still struggling with these scripting challenges. It feels like I have all the LEGO pieces but I'm not sure how I should put them together. I keep consulting documentation, tutorials, solutions, forums, etc. I'm sure this is all part of the process and I'm sure it mimics part of the actual work of a developer, but it's difficult not to let my human emotions get the better of me.

HOWEVER, part of my blog post reflection focused on what I plan to do moving forward into the second half of this challenge which, among other things, is to be more patient with myself and the learning process. It *can* be frustrating only completing 1 challenge, but it doesn't *have* to be. One is better than none. I made a little bit of progress toward my goal of switching careers and that counts for something.
