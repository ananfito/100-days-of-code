### Day 61: October 5, 2022

**Today's Progress:** I continued working [Intermediate Algorithm Scripting](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/#intermediate-algorithm-scripting) challenges on freeCodeCamp; 52% complete.

**Thoughts:** Yesterday, I was struggling with finding a solution to the 'Convert HTML Entities' challenge, but after consulting the hints in the Challenge Guide, I realized the error was in multiple if/then statements to replace the characters with their HTML entity. Further, the hints suggestions splitting the string in to separate parts, then rejoining them.

After taking the hints into consideration I made the necessary changes and the solution passed the test. I think this is another example of where I have the right idea, but my implementation is a little off. I'm not sure how to find a better way to find solutions, other than just more practice.
