### Day 88: November 1, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Today I completed the [QR code component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_sIO_H). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

**Thoughts:** For the most part, this challenge was a review exercise for me. Regardless, I did have a **big takeaway**: when using flexbox and centering content vertically you need to set the `height` parameter of the `body` to `100vh`. This is something I initially forgot to include in my styling sheet. It caused some frustration but I continued to style project until the very end I had to figure it out. Thankfully, I reviewed an old project where I accomplished the same goal and that's when I saw the `height: 100vh` which reminded me what I was missing.

After submitting my solution I received an accessibility report and a comment from a community member. Both provided helpful feedback in making my webpage more accessible, but that task will have to be done another day for now I must rest.
