### Day 89: November 2, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Made corrections to the QR Code Component challenge based on feedback and fell down a tangent learning how to install Node.js and run HTML files through a web server on localhost.

**Thoughts:** I'm grateful for the feedback I received on Frontend Mentor. It makes me want to continue working on projects there; it feels less isolating than working exercises on freeCodeCamp (not that that *isn't* important as well).

The tangent I took to learn how to setup a web server on localhost was interesting but probably more distracting. I understood most of the JavaScript needed to setup the web sever but I think I need to have a deeper conceptual understanding before I progress further. For now, I'm okay with not having it setup but it is something I'd like to study in the future.
