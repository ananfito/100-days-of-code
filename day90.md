### Day 90: November 3, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Today I continued exploring how to style the theme buttons for the calculator app challenge. I managed to get it styled and animated the way it should be, but I don't have the right shape.  

**Thoughts:** I'm really happy I figured out how to style the radio buttons with CSS customization. This something I've been working on for a while now and I'm happy I found a solution - even if it's not the solution I need for the project. While it's a little frustrating to have to learn so many things and still not have what I need for the project, I'm still really grateful for what I am learning because it's helping me practicing HTML/CSS as well as learn so new things along the way (things I wasn't expecting to learn but will probably come in handy later on).

  - This video was helpful in setting up my current customization but I think this video, [CSS Toggle Switch](https://youtu.be/LVPmYBgBdeM), is more of the style I need for this project.
