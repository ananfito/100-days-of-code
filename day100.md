100 Day Challenge Reflection:
- set calculator app project aside
- set up study schedule with even/odd days; odd days for finishing fCC, even days for frontendmentor challenges
- start devlog on dev.to with regular updates on progress
  - share link to twitter
- post weekly reflctions or (TWIL) posts to hashnode
  - this for more in-depth reflection and learning
- be active on Slack and Discord to connect with other learners
  - maybe twitter too but I kind of want to leave the platform behind
