### Day 55: September 29, 2022

**Today's Progress:** I continued working [Intermediate Algorithm Scripting](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/#intermediate-algorithm-scripting) challenges on freeCodeCamp; 43% complete

**Thoughts:** Now that I'm past the regular expressions challenges my progress has been faster and less frustrating. However, I will still need to learn more about regular expressions and plan to write a blog post about the topic so I can understand it on a deeper level.

Overall, today's session was a productive study session, but I did need to consult the solution because my script wasn't working. At first, I thought my logic statement was incorrect so I tried it a few different ways - even though they didn't make sense logically I assumed I was thinking about it wrong. After looking at the solution, it turns out my logic was fine, but I had my `return` statement in the wrong place. -_- I had it in *inside* the `else` statement inside `for` loop when it should have been *outside* the `for` loop all together.

In hindsight, this makes sense and now I know why the `else` statement wasn't being triggered under the appropriate conditions. I'm grateful I made this mistake because it's another example of how you can have your outline, or logic, of a program correct but if something is in the wrong place it won't work probably.

On that note, I've continued outlining my programs with pseudo-code before I begin writing them and this is continuing to help me immensely (even when I make simple mistakes like putting the `return` statement in the wrong place).
