### Day 78: October 22, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Today I took a break from freeCodeCamp and focused on practicing my HTML/CSS skill. Specifically, I completed this [responsive CSS grid tutorial](https://youtu.be/68O6eOGAGqA) by Angela Delise. I also started the [JavaScript DOM Manipulation Course](https://youtu.be/5fb2aPlgoys) taught by [CodeLab](https://www.youtube.com/c/CodeLab98) and hosted on freeCodeCamp's YouTube channel.

**Thoughts:** I've been feeling a little burnt out on completing the challenges on freeCodeCamp's website. I enjoy the learning I gain from them, but they take a lot of effort and sometimes make me feel frustrated to the point of giving up (which I don't want to do). I took this as a signal that it was time to set them aside for now (even though I only have 3 challenges left for the course). Reflecting back on my experience with coding the Tetris game (which I still need to finalize and fix the glitch) I realized that there's a lot to be gained from learning in context.

Angela Delise's tutorial was one I had stumbled upon a while ago and saved. I'm glad I went back to it because it showed me a skill I've been wanting to practicing which is creating responsive website that will change according to the browser size - a vital skill in today's multi-device world. I love how she used a basic example without any content. The outline made it easy for me to see what was being changed and where. I've also got a template that I hope to play around with or even redesign.

The DOM Manipulation course taught by CodeLab was also really exciting. When I coded the Tetris game it seemed obvious for how you would use JavaScript for designing games and other interactive web apps, but this course has extended my knowledge for other use cases. Specifically, I think I see an opportunity for using JavaScript to be able to more easily updated my portfolio site when I want to add a new project and still maintain the styles I've set up.
