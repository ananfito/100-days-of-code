### Day 51: September 25, 2022

**Today's Progress:** I continued working [Intermediate Algorithm Scripting](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/#intermediate-algorithm-scripting) challenges on freeCodeCamp, but I wasn't able to complete the current challenge (Spinal Tap Case).

**Thoughts:** This only part of this particular challenge is the regular expressions. I'm continuing to ready about them and watch tutorials about them, but still struggling. And, sadly, I only had about 20 minutes to study today so my session was much shorter than usual. However, I have been using the website [regexr](https://regexr.com/) which has been really helpful in trying to get a grasp on regular expressions.
