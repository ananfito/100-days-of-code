### Day 87: October 31, 2022

**Today's Progress:** I continued working on the calculator app challenge from Frontend Mentor. I re-watched (and followed along with) the [Custom CSS Radio Button](https://youtu.be/P_koTkWeyXE) tutorial which helped me get closer to customizing the radio buttons to look more like the ones in the design images.

**Thoughts:** Overall, I'm really happy with today's study session. I'm still recovering from a head cold so I was unsure if I would be able to study at all. At certain points I felt a little frustrated but I think that's due more to the fact that I was fatigue than anything else. I know I'm getting closer to having the right style for the Theme buttons on the calculator which makes me really excited because I'm making progress.

I think I might start another Frontend Mentor project so that I can bounce between them when I get stuck. I noticed that taking a break and coming back to the problem helped me think more clearly about the problem and it helped me focus more on the tutorial (rather than just being irritated that it wasn't making sense). This is something I've known and previously experienced BUT it was still a good reminder that it takes time for new ideas to sink and sometimes the best strategy is to walk away and come back later.
