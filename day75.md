### Day 75: October 19, 2022

**Today's Progress:** I continued working [Intermediate Algorithm Scripting](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/#intermediate-algorithm-scripting) challenges 'Binary Agents' and 'Everything Be True' on freeCodeCamp; I am currently 86% complete with this section.

**Thoughts:** Reflecting on my progress over the past 75 days, I'm happy with what I've learned and how I've stayed committed to this challenge, but lately I've been feeling a little burnt out with the challenges on freeCodeCamp. I'm not sure if I need to continue persevering through them or set them aside and work on another JavaScript project.

I only have 3 more challenges to complete until I start the certification projects, but I've also been struggling to make sense of the challenges - and I'm not sure if it's general lack of knowledge or if the challenges are worded vaguely.

Regardless, I'm happy with today's accomplishments. Especially since I learned how to convert from binary to decimal mathematically - something I didn't previously know or forgot. Further, I also learned about the `parseInt()` method which not only helped me solve the 'Binary Agents' challenge (it was the missing piece in my program outline), but it also seems like one of those little bits of knowledge that could prove useful in the future.

Onward to more practice and learning!

  - After failing to find out how to convert binary to decimal, I looked up Matt Lambert's video on the topic (other sources were converting binary to decimal in a different context) and learned about `parseInt()` which was the final piece I needed to solve the 'Binary Agents' challenge
